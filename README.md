# Career Track Analysis with SQL and Tableau

This project explores how students interact with the career tracks offered on the 365 platform. Using SQL, we extract data on student enrollments and completions, and then analyze trends such as completion rates, time to completion, and popular tracks. The insights are visualized in Tableau to better understand student behavior and engagement.

## Files Included
